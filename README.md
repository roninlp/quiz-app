# My first project completely on my own

this is the final solo project in the free React Course On [Scrimba.com](<[scrimba.com](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact)>)

Huge thanks to Bob Ziroll for this great course I was able to get a better grasp on React.

## Challenges

- using states to drive child components and getting data back from child components to change states
- again using states to style the child components dynamically
